# Digital-Code-Based-Signature
In this repository a Python code for generating linear block codes, signing digital documents using a public key encryption scheme based on codes, and verifying a signature is
given. The Python functions that are involved in generating the keys for the public encryption scheme, signing, and verifying a signature are in a private repository to avoid 
being used in a commercial application.
